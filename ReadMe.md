 # Countries Service with Hangfire
 Get information about countries via a RESTful API https://restcountries.eu

 #    Overview
 #    The GetCountries endpoint retrieves a list of countries. The data is fetched either from the cache, the database, or an external API if the first two sources are unavailable.

 #   Steps
 #   Call the API Endpoint

 #   HTTP Method: GET
 #   URL: /get-countries
 #   Response

 #   Success (200 OK): Returns a list of countries.
 #   Error (500 Internal Server Error): Returns an error message if the service fails.
 #    Hangfire is a library for background job processing in .NET applications. It allows you to run tasks at specified intervals or as one-time jobs without blocking the main application thread.

 
 
 # Hangfire is integrated into the Countries_Server project to handle background processing for tasks that should not block the main application thread, such as fetching country data from an external API. This allows the application to perform resource-intensive or time-consuming tasks in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience and high performance.



# The country-fetching logic in the CountryService can run on a recurring basis (e.g. every 30 minutes) to ensure the database and cache always have up-to-date country information.
# Without Hangfire, you would need to manually trigger this process, which could lead to stale data or operational bottlenecks.

# Fetching data from an external API or performing database updates can take time. Using Hangfire offloads these tasks to a background worker, so the main application remains responsive.

# Hangfire provides mechanisms to retry failed tasks, log job progress, and ensure reliable execution even if the application restarts.


# Hangfire comes with a built-in dashboard to monitor job execution, status, and history. This makes it easier to debug and optimize background tasks.
# The test for the GetCountries service ensures that the endpoint retrieves country data correctly under various scenarios. It verifies behavior when data is available in the cache, database, or fetched from an external API. Additionally, it checks for proper error handling and logs when the service encounters issues.
